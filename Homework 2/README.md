# HW 2

The goal of this homework is to create a convolutional neural network for the CIFAR10 data set. 

Make sure that the data is divided into:

    Training set
    Validation set
    Test set

Use the training set to train your neural networks. Evaluate their performance on the validation data set.

After trying several different architectures, choose the one that performs best of the validation set.

Train this final architecture on the data from the training set and validation set and evaluate its performance on the test set.
